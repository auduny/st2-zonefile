# Bind Zone File Syntax Highlighting

I'm loving Sublime Text, but the files I edit most are config files, not code.

Here's a basic syntax highlighting package for zone files.  Nothing fancy, but I understand how to write a highlighter a *little* better now.  

As well, cause I couldn't find it doc'd anywhere, there's a list of the generic scopes that the Color Scheme's should recognize (pulled it from the Solarized theme as that's what I use)

## Installation

[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) -> `Install package` -> `zone`


# Sad Project is Sad

I haven't done anything with this project in *years*. If you like Sublime and Bind, and wish this did more or was better and would like to take over the project, let me know.
